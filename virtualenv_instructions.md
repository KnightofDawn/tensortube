## Virtural Environment Instructions

* Make sure that you have virtualenv installed: `pip install virtualenv`

* Change into the head of the project and call `virtualenv [name]` where name can be whatever you want. `venv` is recommended
* To activate the virtualenv run `source [name]/bin/activate`. To leave the virtualenv call `deactivate`.

* Once you are inside the virtualenv, you can install the requirements for the project by calling `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
